# RustCKKS

RustCKKS enables FHE in Rustlang. FHE can be applied a secure computation that is a computation without a decryption.

# Requirement

RustCKKS has been tested in the following environments.

- rustc 1.49.0 
- ndarray 0.13.0
- ndarray-linalg 0.12.1

# Features

- **Transparency**　You can use easily CKKS encryption scheme even if you don't understand a mathematical background.
- **Bare minimum**　This library provides the bare minimum functionality to use CKKS encryption scheme.
- **Portability** In future, this library can work on WebAssembly. 

# Contribute

I am considering it.
